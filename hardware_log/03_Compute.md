### üíæ External Storage (Optional)

- **Model**: WD 8TB 3.5" HDD (exact model unknown)
- **Price**: Unknown
- **Purchase**: Unknown 
- **Status**: ‚úÖ *Already owned*

#### Specifications
- **Capacity**: 8TB
> ‚úÖ *Optional use ‚Äî if data can be uploaded directly to a cloud server, external storage is unnecessary*  
> ‚úÖ *If cloud upload is unavailable, this drive can serve as temporary backup storage*

### üìå Selection Rationale

The compute system is optimized for **real-time RGB-D recording and on-device AI processing** during outdoor robotic field deployments:

- **Multi-Camera Performance**: The Jetson **Nano 8GB** could not sustain dual ZED streams at 15‚ÄØFPS due to CPU and memory bottlenecks. The AGX Orin handles full-rate capture and processing reliably.  
- **High-Bandwidth Storage**: The Crucial P310 provides sufficient sequential speed for multi-channel RGB-D streaming without frame drops.  
- **Storage Capacity**: 1TB is sufficient ‚Äî ~180‚Äì200‚ÄØGB/hr per ZED (SVO2). Actual field sessions (e.g., in Fargo) rarely exceed 2 hours per run.  
- **Backup Readiness**: An external 8TB HDD is available for local backups when cloud upload is not feasible.  
- **ZED Compatibility**: Includes interface support for **ZED Duo Link capture cards**, ensuring seamless integration with multi-camera setups.

> This configuration balances robust field deployment with the throughput required for dense perception and data collection pipelines.

## ‚ùå Alternatives Considered

### üìå Option: Samsung 990 PRO 2TB w/ Heatsink

**Device**: [Samsung 990 PRO 2TB Gen4 NVMe M.2 SSD (w/ Heatsink)](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHJDY57J)  

**Pros**:  
- Excellent read/write performance (PCIe Gen4)  
- Large 2TB capacity  
- Built-in heatsink for thermal management  

**Cons**:  
- Expensive  
- Heatsink makes it physically incompatible with Jetson AGX Orin slot  
- Not owned  
- High I/O speed not essential due to SVO2 compression  

**Decision**: Rejected due to **price** and **physical incompatibility** with AGX Orin. Current workload (SVO2 recording) does not demand such high-speed storage.
