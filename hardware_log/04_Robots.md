### ðŸ“Œ Selection Rationale

This robot platform was custom-designed to support real-time, multi-sensor data collection in harsh outdoor farm environments. The following factors guided the component selection:

- **Field-proven UGV base**: The **AgileX Scout 2.0** offers a compact, all-terrain base with CAN control, sufficient payload capacity, and runtime for autonomous deployments.  
- **Robust mounting system**: The use of **8020 aluminum extrusions** provides a modular and durable structure that is easy to assemble and reconfigure for various components.  
- **Effective passive cooling**: **Perforated aluminum side panels** promote natural ventilation, helping to dissipate heat during operation under direct sunlight without fans.  
- **Sunlight protection**: A **Thermo-Tec adhesive heat barrier** is applied to the **front, top, and rear panels** to reflect up to 90% of radiant heat, minimizing thermal buildup inside the compute housing.  
- **Environmental durability**: All componentsâ€”frame, panels, and insulationâ€”were selected for compatibility with dust, heat, and solar exposure during prolonged outdoor use.  
- **Precision integration**: All major modules (Jetson AGX Orin, converters, cameras) are mounted using **custom 3D-printed brackets**, ensuring secure fit, vibration resistance, and organized wiring.  
- **Full ownership**: All required materialsâ€”including the robot base, structural frame, thermal components, and 3D-printed mountsâ€”are **already owned**, ensuring deployment can begin without additional fabrication delays.

> This configuration balances ruggedness, thermal stability, and modularityâ€”making it ideal for mobile AI applications in large-scale agricultural environments.
