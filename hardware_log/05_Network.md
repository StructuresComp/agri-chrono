### üìå Selection Rationale

The 5G Dongle + External Antenna setup was chosen based on the following priorities:

- **Uplink Performance**: Real-time video streaming is the primary task, and this setup supports uplink speeds of up to 900 Mbps‚Äîsufficient for high-bandwidth tasks and comparable to the best available solutions.
- **Deployment Environment**: Designed for use in North Dakota (Fargo), where mobile signal quality can vary; the external 4x4 MIMO antenna ensures consistent connectivity on moving platforms.
- **Carrier Compatibility**: The Quectel RM520N-GL module is pre-certified for major global carriers including Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile, NTT DOCOMO, KT, and others‚Äîeliminating the need for additional certification or configuration.
- **Power Efficiency**: The dongle operates directly via USB-C without requiring any external power supply, consuming only ~4‚Äì6W during active operation.
- **Compact and Modular**: The setup is lightweight, space-efficient, and easy to integrate into the Scout robot platform.
- **Stability and Reliability**: The Quectel RM530N-GL module, based on Qualcomm‚Äôs industrial-grade 5G chipset, is known for stable performance in embedded and edge computing environments.
- **Cost-effectiveness**: Total cost (dongle + antenna + high-speed cable) remains under **$500**, offering significantly better value than more complex solutions like Starlink HP or industrial hotspots.

Considering uplink needs, field robustness, and overall integration simplicity, this configuration was selected as the most practical and reliable solution for real-time mobile networking.

## üìù Final Justification

Although Starlink provides unmatched stability, it was rejected due to **logistical complexity**, **cost**, and **form factor**.  
The Netgear M6 Pro hotspot‚Äîwhile high-performing‚Äîoffered **no uplink advantage**, consumed **more power**, had reported **stability issues**, and came at a **significantly higher cost**.

Given that only one Jetson device requires internet access, the **Waveshare 5G Dongle + MIMO Antennas** was chosen as the **most efficient, compact, and reliable** uplink solution for field streaming in North Dakota test environments.
